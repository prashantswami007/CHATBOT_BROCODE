# CHATBOT_BROCODE
We've made a simple chatbot for a restuarant that places order,tracks the order. The backend of the program is performed in python. Instead of using flask and making our own intents we decided to use Google cloud's Dialogflow Framework for the chatbot because we were facing issues in the modules of flask. Talking about the frontend we used html and css to make it.
